    <b>London</b> is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom. Standing on the River Thames in the southeast of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. Londinium was founded by the Romans. The City of London, London's ancient core − covering an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2) and nicknamed the Square Mile − retains its medieval boundaries. The City of Westminster is an Inner London borough which also holds city status. It occupies much of the central area of Greater London including most of the West End. It is to the west of the City of London. Greater London is governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.
